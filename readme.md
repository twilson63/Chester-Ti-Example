This example is a simple projects and tasks example.

## Update

This is a work in progress it does not function, but it should give you an idea of how to structure your coffeescript for the Chester Framework.

## How to install

Assuming you have your Ti Env setup:

* Create a new project for the iPad
* Open Terminal Window in the project directory
* run rm -rf Resources
* run git clone git://github.com/twilson63/chester-ti-example.git Resources

Then you should open up Developer and Launch the simulator
